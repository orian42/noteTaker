## Installation
  

There is no installation process.  The user needs only to visit the webpage.
  

## Usage
  

Webpage URL:  https://notetaker-im4i.onrender.com

The user begins by navigating to the webpage where they will be greeted with a link to the Note Taker app.  The user should click the "Get Started" button to continue.  The user will then be presented with the app that displays saved notes on the left side and a form to enter a new note on the right.  To create a new note, the user need only fill out a title and note text.  When the user begins filling out the form, a "Clear Form" button will appear in the upper right corner.  When clicked, this button will clear the data in the form without saving it.   When text appears in both the "Note Title" and "Note Text" fields, a "Save Note" button will appear next to the "Clear Form" button.  Clicking the "Save Note" button will save the data entered in the form as a new note and the new note will appear on the left side of the screen with the other saved notes.  

The saved notes on the left side only display the title and a delete icon.  The user can read the text of any of these notes by clicking on or around the title of the desired note.  The right side of the screen will display the selected note's title and text.  Furthermore, a "New Note" button will appear in the upper right corner.  Clicking this button will allow the user to clear the form on the right side of the screen to create a new note as described in the paragraph above.  Clicking the delete icon of any note on the left side of the screen will delete the selected note.
